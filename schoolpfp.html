            <h1><font color="D3CFC9">&nbsp;A.School</font></h1>
            <center><p><font color="A8A095">The Tuguegarao City West High School, founded in 2012, has a land area of 1,252 square meters which is under the ownership of the City of Tuguegarao  during the administration of former City Mayor Delfin T. Ting to address the educational needs of the neighboring barangays of the northwest part of Tuguegarao City. Initially, a three-classroom was constructed in the same year that eventually was the establishment.
                <br><br>
                The school has a complete secondary school where it provides educational services to the barangays of PalluaNorteaand Sur, Bagay, Buntun and some children in Linao, Anaffunan, Atulayan and Caritan and nearby barangays of Solana, and Iguig. The people of Barangays Atulayan, Buntun, PalluaNorte, Pallua Sur, and Bagay are truly very lucky to have a new secondary public high school, the Tuguegarao City West High School being put up near these barangays and which started operating on June 4, 2012. Specifically, PalluaNorte, the seat of the newly put up secondary public high school or the Tuguegarao City West High School being added to the five public secondary high schools is centrally located between barangay Buntun and barangay Bagay.
                <br>
                <br>
                For the past several decades, graduates from Buntun Elementary School, Pallua Elementary School, and Bagay Elementary School would enroll at the Cagayan National High School, Cataggaman National High School, or at Linao National High School. The others would enroll in the private schools that would usually demand high or expensive tuition fees and other miscellaneous fees. Moreover, these high schools are even more than two kilometers away from the three other barangays, but with the existence of the integrated schools in barangays Bagay and Pallua Sur, Grade 7 was phased out in Tuguegarao City West High School.
                <br>
                <br>
                Cagayan National High School, the biggest high school in the province of Cagayan and even region wide has an increasing number of enrollees as it accepts not only the enrollees coming from the twenty seven (27) elementary schools in the Division of Tuguegarao City but also those from the nearby towns of Cagayan and Isabela, and even the transients due to the strategic location of Tuguegarao City as a Regional Center.
                <br>
                <br>
                It is noted too, that the clamour of the residents of Barangay Buntun, PalluaNorte, Pallua Sur, Bagay and San Gabriel for the establishment of a Public Secondary School was expressed in a resolution during a Consultative Meeting of the Officials of the DepEd Division of Tuguegarao City, barangay officials and members of the community of Buntun, PalluaNorte, Pallua Sur and Bagay. Moreover, the necessity and urgency of the establishment of the Tuguegarao City West High School were conceived by the Tuguegarao City government earlier in 2010 to ensure better and increased participation and completion rate of their children in high school taking into consideration of the students’ or learners’ expenses for transportation, food or meal allowance, requirements, and travel time in going to school and in going home to their respective homes will be lessened. Furthermore, the proximity of distance of this high school to these barangays also will encourage the physical presence of parents, barangay officials and the community for better, faster wholesome networking with all the DepEd officials and all the school authorities. Thus, the school began.
                <br>
                <br>
                This school is very ideal in terms of its location as it is situated along a cemented highway free from a lot of disturbances since it is several kilometers away from the cockpit, gambling areas or amusement or game centers, public or central market, and fast-food chains. In addition to these, the presence of this school in these nearby barangays is indeed truly practical on the part of the parents or guardians of the students as prices of all commodities and all basic needs are continuously increasing even faster than we can ever think.
                <br>
                <br>
                Hence, all these sufficient and practical reasons paved the way and compelled the Tuguegarao City West High School or more commonly known as Pallua High School which is in conformity with the state’s mandate to protect and promote the right of all citizens to quality education at all levels to open and start its operation as the 6th public secondary school in the Division.
                <br>
                <br>
                Thus, the Local Government of Tuguegarao City, led by the former Mayor Delfin Telan Ting, Division of Tuguegarao City through the leadership of the former Superintendent of the Division of Tuguegarao City, Gilbert N. Tong, Ph.D., CESO VI, now the Superintendent of the Division of Cagayan pushed for the establishment of Tuguegarao City West High School or more commonly known as Pallua High School which is in conformity with the state’s mandate to protect and promote the right of all citizens to quality education at all levels and to take appropriate steps to make such education accessible to all as provided for in our Philippine Constitution.
                <br>
                <br>
                Currently, there are 20 permanent teachers, sixteen (16) Teacher III, four (4) Teacher I ,one (1) Head Teacher;, and a School Head.
                <br>
                <br>
                It has been a heterogeneous sectioning into three (3) organized classes in grades 8,9 and 10. Programs and projects were funded through MOOE, PTA and Donations via the Adopt-A-School Program with the entire support of the PTA, SGC, and LGU-Barangay, and targeted priority areas of concern have been achieved.
                <br>
                <br>
                Honesty and transparency are observed at all times in the form of regular quarterly presentation of Financial Reports during the General PTA Assembly, Homeroom Meetings and posting on the Transparency Board/ Dash Board.
                <br>
                <br>
                The Key Performance Indicators particularly on the enrolment have been improving while others have been maintained. This is due to Enhanced Program on Child-Friendly Environment, continuous intervention to improve students’ performance, Adopt-A-School, Gulayan sa Paaralan and Regular Parent-Teacher-Student Conference, which is the end-goal of the Enhanced School-Based Management.
                <br>
                <br>
                The school implemented the Senior High School (SHS) Program this current school year 2022-2023 to cater to the needs of the Junior High School (JHS) completers from Barangay Bagay, Buntun, Pallua Norte, Pallua Sur, and other nearby barangays.
                <br>
                <br>
                The school offers Humanities and Social Sciences (HUMSS Strands) Curriculum to equip senior high school students to pursue more sociological and artistic careers in their future with the necessary skills and confidence. HUMSS also focuses on developing the students’ oral communication, media and information, and hone their skills in reading and writing to a professional level. HUMSS Strands is intended for those students who wish to explore careers in social sciences, this strand will involve a lot of research and presentation, making it a good preparation for the future careers as journalists, lawyers, teachers, politicians, writers, and psychologists.
